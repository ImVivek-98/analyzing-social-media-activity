# analyzing-social-media-activity

In this notebook, I have used my brother's Facebook and Instagram data (with his consent of course), procured over the course of the last 10 years (2010-2020) to try and perform exploratory data analysis using Python. Through this project, among other things, I intend to find out how his social media usage has varied over different phases of his life, his preference among the two social media platforms, the impact of Covid-19 and the subsequent quarantine period on his social media usage, and the variation of his sleep cycle over the years.
